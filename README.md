# ðŸ“™ About

I am creating this bot with the primary purpose of learning the Rust language.

There is no set goal for the bot; I plan to just add stuff as I experiment with aspects of Rust.

## ðŸ“— Issues/Contact

If find any issues with the bot feel free to open an issue describing the bug.

Alternatively, feel free to message me on Discord @roc.py about the issue or just to talk.
